# Backgammon
A Backgammon game developed in Java

The class named Main2 contains the main fucntion.

Got a new laptop and decided that getting used to the keyboard through a new project might be the way to go.

The code itself is very subpar because I didnt plan on adding as many features as I did.

And as a result the code suffered from bad design and lack of proper modularity.

Might come back to it in the near future and redesign it .
